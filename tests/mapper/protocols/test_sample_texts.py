barren, rocky ridge rises southwards, casting a long, pointed shadow over this

tail end of the ridge, but has now been reduced to little more than a bump in
the field. To the east and north, the field continues, while in the west it
comes to an abrupt end at an erradic line of scattered rocks and clumps of
dirt.

Green, flowering ivy clothes the shrine, and drapes down the crevices in the rock like long, elaborate braids.
